      For this assignment, I compared two LLM models inside Copilot while building my Cat Facts API project. 
      I found that the default GPT‑4o model provided more detailed explanations and cleaner code examples, 
      especially when working with JavaScript modules and Tailwind CSS. The alternate model I tested gave 
      shorter responses and sometimes missed important details, such as how to structure the fetch calls or 
      where to place script tags. For example, when I asked both models to “write a function that fetches 
      a random cat fact,” GPT‑4o returned a complete async function with error handling, while the other 
      model returned only a partial snippet. Overall, GPT‑4o was more helpful and reliable for completing 
      this lab.
