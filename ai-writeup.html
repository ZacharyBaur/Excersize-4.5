      The two AI models I used within Copilot was th standard GPT 4 model, as well as the "Think-Deeper" model, which is designed for more complex topics.
      When using the standard GPT 4 model, the responses I got were filled with a lot more code, while the Think-Deeper model seemed to provide 
      more clean, semantically-correct, and easy to read code. <br><br>I used the same opening prompt with both models: <br>"I am working on an assignment for my Web Development class,
       and I need to use an AI program. Here are the instructions: (Instructions from d2l), The API I want to use is the Cat Facts API (https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/)
       and I would like to style my page with Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/)". <br><br>With this prompt alone, both models generated all necessary pages with seemingly correct code, 
       although the GPT 4 model had much lenghtier code compared to the Think-Deeper model. For example, GPT 4 immediately accessed elements like "document.getElementByID("randomFact")" and then 
       combined that with fetch logic and UI updates inside the same function. In contrast, Think-Deeper generated a much cleaner and more modular solution.
        Its responses focused only on API logic, using modern JavaScript modules such as "export async function getRandomRact()". This seperation of concerns makes the code easier to read and understand, and better suited for a multi-file project.
